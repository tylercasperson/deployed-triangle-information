# Triangle Information using react

## Here is the link to the live website: [Triangle Information in react](https://tylercasperson.github.io/triangle-information/)

## I was asked to create an application to tell more information about a triangle. The user would input 3 numbers (the length of each side). My app was to let them know what type of triangle would be produced.

## To run the app in dev:

- git clone
- cd to the location of the app
- npm start
